##synteny

synteny is a program that reconstructs genome architecture from a clustering file generated by the program usearch (http://drive5.com/usearch/). Output of the 
program consists of two files that describe the synteny in a text format that can be viewed in Excel and also in a .dot format.

### Running synteny

In order to run synteny you need to

1. Cluster the proteins using usearch. We use usearch64 with the parameters -evalue 0.0001 -maxhits 1 -ublast -blast6out.
2. Run synteny

For running synteny use the following command:

```
$ <path-to-synteny-directory>/code/find-synteny.pl
```

You can get a description of the parameters taken by synteny by running this command without parameters:

```
$ code/find-synteny.pl

Usage: /home/itaish/software/GitHub/synteny/code/find-synteny.pl <uclust-file> <connection-threshold> <out-dir> <out-prefix>
```
Where
* **\<uclust-file\>** is the uclust file
* **\<connection-threshold\>** - minimum cluster size required for the cluster to be considered (we use 2)
* **\<out-dir\>** - output directory for files generated by the program
* **\<out-prefix\>** - prefix for output file names under the output directory

### Output
Output consists of the following files:
* **synteny-example.excel.txt** - a file consisting of lines of the following formats:
  **Headers**, start new syntenic regions and contain information about them. For example:
  ```
  ### METACOMPONENT_1000015 (167027 bps, 165.046825396825 genes, 151 backbone genes) ###
  ```
  In this case METACOMPONENT_1000015 is the identifier of the new region, the estimated size for the region is 167,027 bps and it contains 165 genes on 
  average of which 151 genes are backbone genes (namely they appear in all sequences analyzed).
  **Gene lines**, for example:
  ```
  231	BACKBONE	+	1498.5	2
  360	BACKBONE	-	1015	3	2	1	86
  1283	BUBBLE	-	263	3
  ```
  where fields are 
  1. Cluster id
  2. Gene type, either BACKBONE (the gene appear on all sequences) or BUBBLE (the gene appears only on some sequences).
  3. Strand (+/-) 
  4. Number of copies for this gene 
  5. Number of times this gene was found together with the previous gene
  6. Average number of genes between this and previous BACKBONE gene (including BUBBLEs) 
  7. Average distance (in bps) between this and the previous BACKBONE gene. 
* **synteny-example.graph.dot** - a .dot file that describes the gene architecture
* **log-files** - a directory that contains log file to be used for debugging

### example

Can be found in the directory example. Use the command line in the file run for running the example. example/output contains the expected output.
