##synteny

synteny is a program that reconstructs genome architecture from a clustering file generated by the program usearch (http://drive5.com/usearch/). Output of the 
program consists of several files that describe the synteny in different formats.

### Running synteny

In order to run synteny you need to

1. Cluster the proteins using usearch. We use usearch64 with the parameters -evalue 0.0001 -maxhits 1 -ublast -blast6out.
2. Run synteny

For running synteny use the following command:

```
$ <path-to-Lola-directory>/synteny
```

You can get a description of the parameters taken by synteny by running this command without parameters:

```
$ code/find-synteny.pl

Usage: /home/itaish/software/GitHub/synteny/code/find-synteny.pl <uclust-file> <connection-threshold> <out-dir> <out-prefix>
```
Where
* **\<uclust-file\>** is the uclust file
* **\<connection-threshold\>** - minimum cluster size required for the cluster to be considered (we use 2)
* **\<out-dir\>** - output directory for files generated by the program
* **\<out-prefix\>** - prefix for output file names under the output directory

### overlap output
Output consists of the following files:
* **synteny-example.excel.txt** - a file consisting of lines of the following formats:
  * Headers, start new syntenic regions and contain information about it. For example:
  ```
  ### METACOMPONENT_1000015 (167027 bps, 165.046825396825 genes, 151 backbone genes) ###
  ```
  In this case METACOMPONENT_1000015 is the identifier of the new region, the estimated size for the region is 167,027 bps and it contains 165 genes on 
  average of which 151 genes are backbone genes (namely they appear in all sequences analyzed).
  * Gene lines, look like the following:
  ```
  231	BACKBONE	+	1498.5	2
  360	BACKBONE	-	1015	3	2	1	86
  1283	BUBBLE	-	263	3
  ```
  where the first field is the cluster id, BACKBONE genes are genes that appear on all sequences while BUBBLE genes appear only on some. Third field describes 
  on which strand the gene appears, fourth field is the number of copies this gene was found, fifth field indicates how many times it was found 
  with its previous BACKBONE gene on the same sequence, sixth field shows the average number of genes between this and previous BACKBONE gene (including BUBBLEs) 
  and last field indicates the average distance (in bps) between this and the previous BACKBONE gene. 
* **synteny-example.graph.dot** - a .dot file describing the connection between the genes
* **log-files** - a directory that contains log file to be used for debugging

### example

Can be found in the directory example. Use the command line in the file run for running the example. example/output contains the expected output from running 
the command line in run.
